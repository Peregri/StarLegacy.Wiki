# Blasters

Blasters are the pinnacle of modern infantry weaponry. They come in four variants - blaster pistols, rifles, snipers, and cannons.

Blaster recipes require titanium, Size A batteries, and a glass pane.

## Blaster Pistols

Blaster Pistols are cheap to make and cost little power, plus they have the most rapid rate of fire. However they do not do much damage.

> **Speed** 0.2

> **Range** 40 blocks
>
> **Cooldown** 1/4 second
>
> **Max Power** 2500 Power
>
> **Per Shot** 10
>
> **Damage** 6

## Blaster Rifles

Blaster Rifles are your well-rounded standard weapon. They do good damage and they have a fair rate of fire. By far, the best for straight up PVP.

> **Speed** 0.25
>
> **Range** 75 blocks
>
> **Cooldown** 1/2 second
>
> **Max Power** 7500 Power
>
> **Per Shot** 15
>
> **Damage** 15

## Blaster Snipers

Blaster snipers are useful for shooting people at long distances. They do enough damage to one-shot someone who has no armor. Their drawback is that they have a very slow chargeup.

> **Speed** 0.375
>
> **Range** 256 blocks
>
> **Cooldown** 1 second
>
> **Max Power** 20000 Power
>
> **Per Shot** 100
>
> **Damage** 20

## Blaster Cannons

**BLASTER CANNONS HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED.**

Blaster cannons were heavy, expensive weapons which create explosions on impact. They have a fairly slow chargeup for do very good damage. They cost a whopping 50 power per shot, so they are quite expensive to use.

> **Speed** 0.4
>
> **Range** 300 blocks
>
> **Cooldown** 1/2 second
>
> **Max Power** 25000 Power
>
> **Per Shot** 50
>
> **Damage** 20
>
> **Explosion Power** 4.0
