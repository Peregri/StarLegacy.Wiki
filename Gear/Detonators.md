# Detonators
Detonators are explosives which can be used to destroy blocks, even if they are protected by an area shield. They destroy a 5x5x5 area around them.

To use a detonator, right click while holding one and it will be thrown in the direction you are looking. They detonate 1.5 seconds after being thrown. If they come in contact with an object, they stick to it and start beeping. They also do damage to entities in their blast radius, enough to kill someone in a space suit instantly and do decent damage to someone in power armor.

Detonators are relatively expensive, so it is wise to use them sparingly and not carry too many, lest you die and lose them all.
