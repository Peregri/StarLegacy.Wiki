# Wires
Wires are similar to pipes, except they transfer power between machines.

# Wire Logics
There are many relevant blocks for power transfer.

## Noteblock
There is a note block on every power machine multiblock. 
- They are used for power input.
- Extractors can also extract from them.

## Extractor
Extractors are crafting tables and you will often find these on many of the power machines. 
- They can extract power into wires and connectors.

 - The more extractors you have in a chunk, the less they are ticked. 
 
 > All extractors tick used or not, so making use of all extractors is most efficent.

## Wire
Wires (end rods) are the fastest and best for simple long distance power transfer.
* They can only go straight forward.
* They can take power from iron/redstone blocks, connectors, extractors, and other wires.
* They can give power to any of the above plus noteblocks and minus extractors.

## Connectors
Also known as technical (or sponge blocks), these blocks are like wires except:
* They can transfer power from all sides. 
* They can't take power from iron blocks. However, they can still give power to iron blocks.

## Iron/Redstone Blocks
These are like sponge blocks, but with a few key differences.
* They cannot give power to sponges and they can't take power from extractors.
* They also give power to the block opposite of the direction they took power from if one is available.
