# Pipes
Pipes are useful tools that allow you to efficiently and neatly transport and organize items. Pipes for managing factories and furnace systems and for unloading/loading material onto ships.

Glass pipes are used to make long and potentially complicated systems. Glass pipes attempt to put items into containers next to them if available and also move onto connected pipes. If there are two possible directions for them to go, they pick randomly, which generally ends up in evenly spreading out the items.

Pipes can be in the form of glass pains or full glass blocks. Different colored glass pains and full blocks when used in as pipes when touching they will not mix. For example if you have a green line on one side and a red line on the other side and they are touching with no blocks in-between the items going through red will not interfere and will not go into the line of green.

## Containers
Containers store items. Examples of containers are Chests, Trapped chests, Droppers, Dispensers and Hoppers. Hoppers DO NOT work as extractors so they cannot be use to take items out of other storage containers and place them into pipes. Ender chests are also incapable of being used with pipes or extractors.

## Extractor
The extractor is used to take items out of containers and place them in to the pipe network.

To use the extractor, you need a crafting table, a container, and a glass pipe system. Place the crafting table next to the container and connect the glass to the crafting table. The pipe system will then search for another container that is touching the glass pipe and send the items from the container to the new container.

## Set up
To set up a pipe system you need a crafting table, glass blocks or glass pains, and two separate containers. This is an example of a correctly made pipe system:

![PipeExample1]

In the set up above, an output container is connected to two input container, making it so when an item goes in the output container, it travels into one of the input chests. This is an example of the same system except using glass pains instead of full glass blocks:

## Sorting System
Using pipes we can create an automatic, fast and no red-stone sorting system.

To make a sorting system you will need the following items:
- Hopper
- Glass Pain (3 different colors)
- Chest & Trapped chest
- Crafting Table
- Item to be sorted
- Item for FILLER

To begin construction, plan out the area you will want before continuing. You will want to plan after looking through the pictures and steps of how to make your sorting system below.

1. Place down a chest and a crafting table next to it.
2. Connect and make a pipeline to the crafting table.
3. Make a second pipeline one block away from the first using alternating colours, so they aren't touching.
4. Make a row of hoppers between the two pipelines, facing the second.
5. Place down a row of alternating chests and trapped chests on the other side of the second pipeline.
This should look something like this:

![SortingPipeline]

NOTE: They can be any colors you wish, as long as they are different from each other.
The hoppers are used for the actual sorting. You need to place the items you want in the corresponding chest in the hopper, and then use a filler item(an item to fill empty slots) in the rest of the slots to prevent random items appearing in the chest. Remember that a single hopper can only hold 5 items. Example:

![Hopper]

The Snowballs are the filler item, and the brick, wheat, and sugar cane count as the sorting items.

NOTE: The filler in the system has to be an item that would not flow through your system. If the item is to flow through the system it can go into any chest. To make sure it doesn't, name the item using an anvil.
