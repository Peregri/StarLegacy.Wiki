# Auto Crafters
Auto crafters are machines used to mass produce a specific crafting recipe using input and output chests,
crafting the recipe given in the recipe holder dropper/dispenser block.

Auto Crafters come in 3 tiers. Higher tiers craft items faster (thus using more power).

- **Tier 1** (Iron) (2 crafts/second) (200,000 power capacity)
- **Tier 2** (Gold) (4 crafts/second) (400,000 power capacity)
- **Tier 3** (Diamond) (6 crafts/second) (600,000 power capacity)

To unlock them, use i.e. `/advance AUTO_CRAFTER_ONE`. They cost C5,000, C10,000, and C20,000.

## Usage

- Put `[autocrafter]` on the first line of the sign
- The input container is the container on the left side of the multiblock, atop the glass block.
- The output container is the container on the right side of the multiblock, atop the crafting table.
- In the dropper/dispenser in the center, place the recipe as if you were crafting the item normally.
