# Starship Types
Every starship has a type.
Starship types have their own stats.
These include block size limits, power output, and container percent.

They are split into freighters and warships.

You unlock these by leveling up. At level 1, you get shuttles.
Every 12 levels, you unlock the next tier warship and freighter.

Container percent is the percent of blocks that can be inventory blocks.
Chests count as three inventory blocks.

### Acceleration
Ships can move faster when shift flying for extended times.
The acceleration distance is the amount of blocks a ship must fly
to make it go 1 block per movement faster, and max acceleration is
the most it can move in 1 movement.

## Warships
Warships can have up to **2.5% containers**.
They have a higher power output than freighters, so they're better as combat ships.
However, they can only carry half as many cargo crates.

## Freighters
Warships can have up to **4.5% containers**.
While they cannot do as well as a warship in combat, freighters can transport large amounts of items easily.
They can also be used to trade cargo missiosn between planets.

## Specialized

Specialized ships have varying statistics. These ships serve one purpose extremely well while also having it's other statistics lowered accordingly.
